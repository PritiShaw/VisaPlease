# **Visa Global Intern Hackathon (Innovation Challenge) - Payments and the Pandemic**
#### **Theme: Small Business Merchants**
#### **Team VisaPlease**

#### **Overview**
During this unprecedented time and the global impact of COVID-19 many small businesses have felt the impact much greater than that of their larger counterparts. Small businesses are privately owned corporations, partnerships or sole proprietorships that have fewer than 500 employees and less than $7 million in annual revenues. Visa is uniquely positioned to help small businesses come back stronger by providing solutions that enable their operations.
As small businesses are the main driving force and engine of the Americaâ€™s economy, ensuring the survival of small businesses are critical.
