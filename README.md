# **Visa Global Intern Hackathon (Innovation Challenge) - Payments and the Pandemic**
#### **Theme: Small Business Merchants**
#### **Team VisaPlease**

### **Why did we choose this theme?**
During this unprecedented time and the global impact of COVID-19 many small businesses have felt the impact much greater than that of their larger counterparts. Small businesses are privately owned corporations, partnerships or sole proprietorships that have fewer than 500 employees and less than $7 million in annual revenues. Visa is uniquely positioned to help small businesses come back stronger by providing solutions that enable their operations.
As small businesses are the main driving force and engine of the America’s economy, ensuring the survival of small businesses are critical.

### **What is our Solution?**
Our team, VisaPlease, has created a web application, VRecover which is powered by Visa’s APIs.  
VRecover allows small business merchants to check their recovery score from pandemics such as COVID-19 and identify their strengths and weaknesses which they might have overlooked. It also provides information on nearby suppliers with the help of VISA APIs and tips based on data analysis for recovering.

#### **Main Functionalities**
* A business recovery score calculator to evaluate how well a business is recovering from the on going COVID-19 pandemic.
* A supplier locator to help small merchants locate local suppliers.
* A tracker to help merchants keep track of their scores and analyse their growth.
* A score analyser to analyse the merchant data which is collected from the questionnaire and pin point the area which may lead to the merchant's fall in performance.

#### **Visa APIs Used**
**Merchant Locator API**
- Locate local suppliers in the Merchant's Neighbourhood
- Fetch merchant related data needed for calculating the recovery score

**Merchant Measurement API**
